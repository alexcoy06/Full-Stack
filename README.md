# Basic Python Practice

I am completing Dr. Angela Yu's course on becoming a full-stack web developer, which offers a comprehensive journey through essential technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and DApps. Throughout the course, participants gain hands-on experience in each technology, building practical skills through project-based learning. By the end of the program, I will acquire proficiency in front-end and back-end development, database management, and decentralized applications. Dr. Angela Yu's structured approach ensures a solid foundation in web development, empowering me to tackle diverse coding challenges and excel in real-world applications.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Open your terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexcoy06/Full-Stack-Practice.git
   cd Full-Stack-Practice
   ```

2. **Open the Project in VSCode:**
   After navigating to the project directory, you can open it in VSCode by running:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

### Deployment Resources

For deployment, I'm utilizing several tools and features to streamline my workflow: Prettier for code formatting, Live Preview for real-time updates, the Material Icon Theme for visual organization, and VS Code integrated with Chrome for efficient development and testing of web applications.

## Repository Structure

The following folders will be organized by folder and indicate the level of skill being applied. As the names will suggest, the project will be based off of that topic.

### HTML

- **Basic:** List of shows I enjoy
- **Intermediate:** Birthday Invitation
- **Index:** First Website Portfolio

### CSS

- **Intro:** Japanese(Katakana) Color Flashcards
- **Basic:** Motivational Meme
- **Intermediate:** The Flag of Laos

## Improvement

Any and all improvements will be displayed here as new methods and insights are discovered.

7/11  
Capstones related to my practice will be titled `FS-Capstone` followed by a number indicating their order of completion as Full Stack projects. A smaller number signifies an older project and vice versa.

7/26  
Discovered that the CSS4 update introduces support for nesting rules within other rules, allowing for more organized and hierarchical styling, eliminating the need to use preprocessors like SASS, personally.
