# Basic Python Practice

I am completing Dr. Angela Yu's course on becoming a full-stack web developer, which offers a comprehensive journey through essential technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and DApps. Throughout the course, participants gain hands-on experience in each technology, building practical skills through project-based learning. By the end of the program, I will acquire proficiency in front-end and back-end development, database management, and decentralized applications. Dr. Angela Yu's structured approach ensures a solid foundation in web development, empowering me to tackle diverse coding challenges and excel in real-world applications.
